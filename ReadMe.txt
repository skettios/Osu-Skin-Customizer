====== 1. What is this? =======
===============================
This is simply a way to have multiple style of skins without having to package each individual style and all the combinations of them.



===============================
==== 2. How do I use this? ====
===============================
To use this you must understand a file structure for your addons. For me I would put all my addons in an addons folder at the root of the skin, with this at the root as well.
You also need to configure every aspect of the customizer. From tabs, to categories to the addons themselves. Once all configured it should just all work!
